#### Hello, I'm Thomas!
I am a software developer, based out of Atlanta, Georgia. 

I'm passionate about crafting robust software, building cloud-native solutions, and following the ever-changing FinTech industry.

On a more personal level, I am a Christian, saved by grace alone. I enjoy spending time with friends and family, strolling through nature, and playing mandolin.
